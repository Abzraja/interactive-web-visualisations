## <span id="outline"></span>Outline
* This challenge required the use of the Javascript [Plotly](#plotly) library to create Plots from a Belly Button Biodiversity [Dataset](#dataset). 
* Some sample JSON Data from the Dataset was given to present on an interactive Dashboard. The dashboard was built using [bootstrap](#bootstrap) for responsiveness.
* [D3](#d3) was also used to append the selection box with the Subject ID values from the Belly Button JSON Data and then update the Plots based on the Subject ID selected. The D3 script was called in the HTML.
* [Plotly](#plotly) was used to create the plots. Plotly and the script written to create the plots was called in the HTML.



## Dataset
* <span id="dataset"></span>[Belly Button Biodiversity](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/)

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Issues

* The marker colours on the bubble plot do no match the homework example. It seems a different colour scale was used for that example.

* The link for the bonus task given in the homework instructions does not have a gauge similar to the one on the homework example. But the homework instructions state to use the code from that page. So my gauge is different from the example but still displays the correct data required - which is the Belly button washing frequency of the subject.
